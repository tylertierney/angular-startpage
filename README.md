# Customizable Browser Startpage

I've been using this project as an opportunity to explore more of Angular, i.e. ng, services, directives, and observables.

This app provides a simple interface that allows users to generate and customize a browser homepage.

Users can choose from a number of preset 'bookmarks', edit the URLs, change the background, change their name, and change whether the bookmark icons are colored.

All user preferences are stored within the browser's localStorage object.
